# TWISTLY CBD WEBSITE REFACTORING PLAN

## OVERVIEW
This plan provides a systematic approach to clean up and optimize the Twistly CBD website codebase,
ensuring we have a solid foundation for finalizing features and launching the site.

## 1. PROJECT ASSESSMENT

### Current Issues:
- Bloated codebase with unused components/sections
- Duplicate code and redundant files
- Unoptimized file/folder structure
- Image directory needs cleanup
- Update scripts (update-*.js) that may be obsolete
- Inconsistent UI/UX patterns
- Incomplete shop functionality

### Goals:
- Streamlined, maintainable codebase
- Optimized performance
- Consistent UI/UX
- Fully functional e-commerce features
- Mobile-first responsive design

## 2. CODEBASE CLEANUP

### Component Audit:
1. Map all currently used components via import analysis
   - Start from page components and follow the import tree
   - Document component dependencies

2. Identify unused components
   - Check for components not imported anywhere
   - Check for components imported but not rendered

3. Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Merge similar components
   - Create more generic, reusable components

4. Delete or archive unused files
   - Move to an "archived" folder first before deletion
   - Maintain git history for reference

### Pages & Routing Cleanup:
1. Document active routes and their dependencies
   - Map the complete routing structure
   - Identify necessary layout components

2. Remove unused page files
   - Check analytics for unused routes if available
   - Remove routes that don't serve the core business

3. Standardize page structure
   - Consistent layouts
   - Shared components
   - Proper metadata

### Scripts Cleanup:
1. Identify and document functionality of utility scripts
   - What do update-*.js files actually do?
   - Are they still needed?

2. Delete obsolete scripts
   - Remove update scripts after confirming they're no longer needed
   - Keep only necessary build/utility scripts

### Asset Optimization:
1. Audit image usage across the site
   - Which images are actually displayed?
   - Which can be optimized or removed?

2. Organize image directory
   - Create logical structure: logos, products, banners, etc.
   - Use consistent naming conventions

3. Delete unused images
   - Remove all images not referenced in the codebase
   - Consider creating an archive for potential future use

4. Optimize remaining images
   - Compress and resize for web
   - Convert to modern formats (WebP)
   - Add proper alt text and metadata

## 3. CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

### Component Refactoring:
1. Standardize component interfaces

   - Identify redundant state

2. Optimize state management
   - Centralize global state
   - Use local state where appropriate
   - Implement proper context providers

3. Ensure proper data flow
   - One-way data flow
   - Proper state initialization

2. Optimize image loading
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Use proper sizing
   - Add loading priority to critical images

3. Code splitting
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Component-based code splitting

### Bundle Optimization:
1. Analyze bundle size
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Check for duplicate packages

2. Reduce bundle size
   - Tree-shake unused code
   - Split code into chunks
   - Lazy-load non-critical features

3. Optimize third-party dependencies
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Consider smaller alternatives
   - Implement proper import strategy
