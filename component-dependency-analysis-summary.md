# Component Dependency Analysis Summary

## Key Findings

1. **High Component Duplication in Category Pages**
   - Each product category page (Health & Wellness, Pet CBD, etc.) uses nearly identical component structure
   - Components are duplicated with minor variations rather than reused with different props
   - These duplicate components consume significant codebase space and make maintenance difficult

2. **Several Potentially Unused Components**
   - Many section components appear unused, particularly in the `/sections` directory
   - Some UI components like FeatureCard, Highlighter, Marquee, and Spotlight may be unused
   - AiChatHero may not be in active use despite recent edits

3. **Obsolete Utility Scripts**
   - Several update scripts (update-*.js) were one-time migration tools and are now obsolete
   - These scripts can be safely removed to clean up the codebase

4. **Well-Structured UI Component Library**
   - Core UI components (Button, Card, etc.) are well modularized following shadcn/ui patterns
   - These components are heavily reused across the application

5. **Complex Shop Implementation**
   - Shop page has complex state management and many component dependencies
   - May benefit from refactoring into smaller, more manageable components

## Recommended Action Items

### 1. Component Consolidation

**High Priority:**
- Create shared, themeable components for product category pages
- Replace duplicated components with these shared components
- Estimated impact: Reduction of ~30-40% in component code

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create themeable versions of: HeroSection, BenefitsSection, FeaturedProducts, TestimonialsSection, CtaSection, FaqSection
2. Update each category page to use these shared components
3. Delete duplicate components after migration

### 2. Clean Up Unused Components

**Medium Priority:**
- Verify and remove unused components
- Archive components that might be needed later
- Estimated impact: Reduction of ~15-20% in component code

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create an 'archived' directory for potentially useful components
2. Move verified unused components to this directory
3. Delete components that are clearly obsolete

### 3. Remove Obsolete Scripts

**Low Priority:**
- Delete one-time migration scripts
- Estimated impact: Cleaner project root directory

**Scripts to Remove:**
- update-all-shadcn-imports.js
- update-carousel-imports.js
- update-tabs-imports.js
- update-separator-imports.js
- update-badge-imports.js
- update-button-imports.js
- update-aspect-ratio-imports.js
- update-badge-component.js

### 4. Optimize Shop Implementation

**Medium Priority:**
- Refactor shop page into smaller components
- Improve state management
- Estimated impact: Better performance and maintainability

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Extract filter functionality into a separate component
2. Extract product grid into a separate component
3. Consider using React Query or similar for data fetching/caching

### 5. Reorganize Component Structure

**Medium Priority:**
- Improve component organization and naming consistency
- Estimated impact: Better developer experience and code maintainability

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Group related components together
2. Consider a more consistent naming convention
3. Improve component documentation

## Impact Assessment

The proposed refactoring would result in:
- ~30-40% reduction in component code through consolidation
- ~15-20% reduction through removal of unused components
- Improved maintainability and developer experience
- Better performance due to optimized shop implementation
- Cleaner project structure

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize the action items based on project timeline and resources
2. Create a detailed implementation plan for each action item
3. Consider creating a staging branch for major refactoring work
4. Implement changes systematically, with thorough testing after each change
5. Document all changes for team reference
