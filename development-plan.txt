# CBD Website Development Plan

## Current Status
- Successfully optimized the HomePageHeroSection for mobile and desktop
- Restyled the CategoryHighlights section to match the hero section's design
- Created a consistent container structure with better spacing and mobile responsiveness

## Container Structure Analysis

### Current Approach:
We're currently using a nested container approach:
1. Outer section with background decorations
2. Container component (max-w-6xl)
3. Inner white container with backdrop-blur, border, and shadow
4. Content components inside

### Benefits of This Approach:
- Consistent visual style across sections
- Clear separation between sections
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Easier to maintain spacing and alignment
- Improved visual hierarchy

### Recommendation:
âœ… **Continue with the nested container approach for all sections**

This creates a cohesive design language throughout the site while allowing each section to have its own identity. The outer container provides layout structure, while the inner container creates the "card" effect.

## Tomorrow's Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Standardized Container Components (1 hour)
- Create a `SectionContainer` component that can be reused across all sections
- Parameters for background colors, decorations, and padding
- Example:
```tsx
<SectionContainer 
  background="green" 
  decorations={true} 
  spacing="compact"
>
  {/* Section content */}
</SectionContainer>
```

### 2. Optimize Remaining Homepage Sections (3 hours)
In priority order:
1. FeaturedProducts section
2. BlogSection
3. Testimonials
4. CBDBenefits
5. DrTwistly AI Consultant

For each section:
- Apply the nested container structure
- Optimize for mobile-first design
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography
- Reduce component height/size for better viewport fit

### 3. Standardize Category Page Layouts (2 hours)
- Create consistent container structures for all category pages
- Implement shared layout components for:
  - HeroSection
  - BenefitsSection
  - FeaturedProducts
  - TestimonialsSection

### 4. Mobile Navigation Improvements (1 hour)
- Optimize the NavigationGrid for mobile
- Create a compact mobile menu
- Ensure proper spacing and touch targets

### 5. Performance Optimization (1 hour)
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile
- Optimize image loading
- Implement better code splitting

## Design Guidelines to Follow

### Container Structure
```
<section> (background + decorations)
  <Container> (max-width constraint)
    <div> (white card with border/shadow)
      <content> (actual section content)
    </div>
  </Container>
</section>
```

### Spacing Guidelines
- Section padding: py-5 sm:py-6
- Container padding: p-4 sm:p-6
- Content spacing: gap-3 sm:gap-4
- Margins between elements: mb-4 sm:mb-6

### Typography Scale
- Headings: text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl
- Subheadings: text-base sm:text-lg
- Body: text-sm sm:text-base
- Small text: text-xs

### Mobile Optimization Guidelines
- Start with mobile layout first
- Use grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3
- Reduce padding and margin for mobile
- Simplify complex components
- Limit height to prevent scrolling

## Questions to Consider
1. Should we use a different color scheme for each category page?
2. Do we need to maintain the same container styling across all pages?
3. How do we handle very content-heavy sections?
4. Should we reduce animation on mobile to improve performance?

## Next Steps After Tomorrow
1. Implement dark mode support
2. Improve accessibility
3. Add loading states and transitions
4. Optimize for larger screens (>1440px)

Remember: Mobile-first, consistent spacing, and performance are our priorities!

## Design Language
- Clean white cards with subtle shadows
- Consistent border styles (border-green-200/90)
- Subtle gradients and background patterns
- Rounded corners (rounded-xl)
- Backdrop blur effects
- Small interactive animations
