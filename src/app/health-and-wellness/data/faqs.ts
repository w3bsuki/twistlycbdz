    question: "What is CBD and how does it work?",
    answer: "CBD (cannabidiol) is a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants. It works with your body's endocannabinoid system, which helps regulate functions like mood, sleep, pain, and immune response. Unlike THC, CBD doesn't cause a 'high' and is legal in most states when derived from hemp with less than 0.3% THC."

  {
    question: "What are the benefits of using CBD for wellness?",
    answer: "Many people use CBD to help manage stress, anxiety, sleep issues, and discomfort. Research suggests that CBD may have anti-inflammatory properties, help regulate mood, and promote better sleep quality. Everyone's experience varies, and scientific research is still emerging on CBD's full range of benefits."

  {
    question: "How should I choose the right CBD product?",
    answer: "When choosing a CBD product, consider your specific wellness goals, preferred consumption method, and potency needs. For sleep support, products containing CBN may work best. For daily wellness, a regular CBD oil may be sufficient. Start with lower strengths if you're new to CBD, and always look for third-party tested products with clear labeling of CBD content."

  {
    question: "Will CBD make me feel intoxicated?",
    answer: "No, CBD won't make you feel high or intoxicated. It's non-psychoactive, meaning it doesn't alter your mental state like THC does. Many users report feeling more relaxed or experiencing relief from discomfort without any cognitive impairment. You can use our CBD products during your normal daily activities."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take for CBD to work?",
    answer: "The time it takes to feel CBD's effects depends on your consumption method. Sublingual oils typically take 15-30 minutes, while edibles may take 1-2 hours as they pass through your digestive system. For some conditions like anxiety or pain, you might notice effects quickly, while for others like sleep or inflammation, consistent daily use for 2-4 weeks may be needed to see optimal results."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between full spectrum, broad spectrum, and CBD isolate?",
    answer: "Full spectrum CBD contains all compounds naturally found in the hemp plant, including trace amounts of THC (less than 0.3%). This creates an 'entourage effect' where compounds work together. Broad spectrum CBD contains multiple cannabinoids but no THC. CBD isolate is pure CBD with no other cannabinoids or hemp compounds. Full spectrum often provides the most pronounced effects due to the entourage effect."

  {
    question: "Can I take CBD with my current medications?",
    answer: "CBD can interact with certain medications by affecting how they're metabolized in your liver. If you're taking any prescription medications, especially those with a 'grapefruit warning,' consult with your healthcare provider before using CBD. This includes blood thinners, anti-seizure medications, and some antidepressants. Your doctor can provide guidance specific to your medical situation."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best way to take CBD for wellness?",
    answer: "The best method depends on your preferences and needs. Sublingual oils offer good absorption and medium onset time. Edibles provide longer-lasting effects but take longer to work. Topicals are excellent for targeted relief on specific body areas. For general wellness and daily balance, many people prefer sublingual oils taken consistently each day, while for sleep support, an edible taken 1-2 hours before bedtime may work best."
