### Next Steps:
We will now proceed with the Page Structure Standardization as outlined in the proposed addition to the plan. This will involve:

1. Creating page layout templates with consistent sections for:
   - Hero sections
   - Product grids
   - Benefits/features sections
   - Testimonials
   - FAQs
   - CTAs

2. Standardizing page structure across category pages:
   - Health and Wellness (Green theme)
   - Beauty and Cosmetics (Purple theme)
   - Sport and Recovery (Blue theme) 
   - Pet CBD (Amber theme)
   - Hybrid and Mushrooms (Custom theme)

3. Implementing consistent theming by category:
   - Utilizing our standardized component props system
   - Applying appropriate colorScheme to all components on a page
   - Establishing consistent visual hierarchy

4. Creating page-specific components where necessary while maximizing reuse of existing components

Immediate next tasks:
- Review existing page layouts to identify patterns
- Create a standard page template component
- Begin updating Health and Wellness page as the first implementation

### Completed Tasks:
#### Button Component Standardization
1. ✅ Reviewing both Button implementations
   - `src/components/ui/button.tsx`: Enhanced version with more variants (green, blue, purple, amber), sizes (xs, xl), and rounded options
   - `src/components/common/ui/button.tsx`: Basic shadcn implementation with fewer options
2. ✅ Decision: Keep the enhanced version in `/components/ui/button.tsx` as it has more features and appears to be more customized for the project
3. ✅ Update all imports to use the chosen implementation (`@/components/ui/button`)
   - Created and executed script that updated 14 files with incorrect imports
   - Manually updated 3 files importing buttonVariants
4. ✅ Remove the duplicate implementation in `common/ui/button.tsx`
5. ✅ Verification
   - Checked if there are any components still importing from the common/ui/button.tsx
   - Found and fixed 3 files importing buttonVariants from the wrong path
   - Verified that the updated components work correctly with the ui/button.tsx implementation
   - Examined the cta.tsx component as an example, imports and usage look correct

#### Badge Component Standardization
1. ✅ Reviewing both Badge implementations
   - `src/components/ui/badge.tsx`: Simpler version with fewer variants (default, outline)
   - `src/components/common/ui/badge.tsx`: More variants (default, secondary, destructive, outline)
2. ✅ Decision: Use the feature-rich version from common/ui but move it to ui/badge.tsx
   - Examined current usage and found "destructive" variant being used in the product card components
   - The common/ui version has all needed variants (default, secondary, destructive, outline)
3. ✅ Update component and imports
   - Created and ran `update-badge-component.js` script to replace the ui/badge.tsx with the enhanced version
   - Created and ran `update-badge-imports.js` script to update imports in 8 files
4. ✅ Remove the duplicate implementation in `common/ui/badge.tsx`

#### Dialog Component Standardization
1. ✅ Reviewing both Dialog implementations
   - `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`: Uses bg-white background and lighter overlay with blur
   - `src/components/common/ui/dialog.tsx`: Uses themed bg-background and darker overlay without blur
   - Both implementations have identical structure and exported components
2. ✅ Decision: Improve the ui/dialog.tsx with the best features from both
   - Keep the ui version as the primary implementation since it's already being used consistently
   - Update the overlay to use a slightly darker background (70% opacity) while keeping the blur effect
   - Change the hardcoded white background to use the theme-based bg-background for better dark mode support
3. ✅ Update imports
   - Verified all components are already correctly importing from @/components/ui/dialog
4. ✅ Remove the duplicate implementation in `common/ui/dialog.tsx`
5. ✅ Fix issues
   - Fixed a missed Dialog import in health-section.tsx file that was still using the removed dialog component

#### Card Component Standardization
1. ✅ Reviewing both Card implementations
   - `src/components/ui/card.tsx`: Uses div elements for title and description, has rounded-xl corners
   - `src/components/common/ui/card.tsx`: Uses semantic h3 and p elements, has rounded-lg corners and shadow-sm
2. ✅ Decision: Combine the best features from both
   - Add 'use client' directive for Next.js compatibility
   - Use rounded-lg corners and shadow-sm for a more subtle appearance
   - Use semantic HTML elements (h3 for CardTitle, p for CardDescription) for better accessibility
   - Set text-2xl for CardTitle to maintain proper hierarchy
3. ✅ Update imports
   - Updated 5 files that were importing Card from common/ui path
4. ✅ Remove the duplicate implementation in `common/ui/card.tsx`

#### Tabs Component Standardization
1. ✅ Reviewing both Tabs implementations
   - `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`: Standard shadcn implementation
